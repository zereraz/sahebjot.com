Do you know the theme to your life?

We humans enter this world, most crying, confused, equally enamoured with the sudden stimuli shock. We wouldn’t know what confusion means but we could feel it, not knowing, facing unknowns with little to no knowledge. A sort of fated(deterministic) existence unravels for the next few years.

As we grow older, we start to play more and more in the world. The world is so vast, diverse, unending, ever exciting and new to our young minds. We live our lives, facing many odds and partaking in joys. 
At some point we encounter some hard(relatively) questions, realisations about reality. The idea of the world we had in our head changes, becomes deeper in a sense. The older model still worked for many cases but this new model gives a certain depth, sometimes emotional or intellectual. It maps reality more accurately. Models of world are carved within while playing. Everyday begins a new adventure or sometimes removing boredom becomes a challenge in itself. This is our becoming more than we were, uncovering reality, discovering sometimes rediscovering old aspects of ourselves, like a plant even our mental/psychological aspects grow.

More time passes. Even though most of us came here confused but by now some of us have collected some answers or pieces of answers, others forgot the questions or outright ignored them. We sprint through life trying to live and make best of our circumstances. Eventually some form of midlife, quarter life crisis will re-trigger the patterns of revising our models of the world of ourselves and our place here. We try to collect some meaning, sometimes to bear the suffering in life or to make the most of living itself.

While going through life, who is collecting? Collecting the meaning, the questions, the answers all the while living. Even if not explicitly within the conscious part. This aspect of yourself I’m calling the Seeker. The aspect that isn’t easily satisfied, looking for something deeper, perplexed by some very hard questions.

[Existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism) is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the problem of human existence and centres on the lived experience of the thinking, feeling, acting  individual. 
There are some very hard questions in your bag, you collected encountered and you have the **need** to solve them. The seeker aspect is a wanderer, clearly we don’t know the answer yet. Some give up, call it absurd a sort of pride in the conclusion that there is nothing to it and they know it. The pride is in the strength of being able to accept that which isn’t, but deep down there was a wish of something to it. In my opinion they just give up, for many after herculean efforts and for others looking at such efforts and following their answers. The absurdity is in the lack of elegance, to exist, seek and yet nothing to it creates a void.
If there was some deep rooted/underlying meaning to existence then that could be used to generate meaning as much as needed as that is why there is existence, an inherent underlying ocean of meaning. Respite to that painful existential thirst.

Recognise that seeker within, nurture it. Look for the signal within the noise, the lighthouse in this terrifying world ocean. A single candle illuminating dense murky  darkness. Seemingly scary questions, don’t run from it or take it personally. Why ignore what one has to face eventually, delayed gratification in here would give dividends to a much more meaningful and joyous existence. This seeker is a meaning generating part of your being. It can get clogged by too many piled up questions or unintegrated answers.

A seekers journey is what is running within a hero who embarked on a journey.

The Seeker which is within i.e part of your being, which cuts through the foggy confusion of life and gives direction akin to the Promethean foresight.
Just imagine how relieved you will be in life if death isn’t a worry ever, suffering of world isn’t so perplexing and other such questions. When such categorical/a class of questions are answered you are relieved of stress, anxiety and pain across large spans of life. An asymmetry exists qualitatively. These are special questions just like their answers and the meaning it generates for you.

Some characteristics of how I see an ideal seeker.

* **Honesty**: Most important is not to lie, mainly to yourself. If you lie to yourself you are only making - the path to you travel more murky/confusing and hard to traverse.
* **Openness**: The seeker is ever open, to knowledge questions. No cursory hand waving, seeker deep down knows whether they understand the meaning, implications or there is the sense of confusion within. Open to intuitive knowings/gnosis and experiential knowledge.
* **Depth Seeking**: Avoiding surface level, getting the crux, the core of something requires going deep into it.
* **Broad Picture**: Seeker can go deep as well as see the big picture, overview. Connect the dots eventually, notice macro patterns.
* **Sincerity**: A seeker is a student, student of life, world, anything which can guide it to what it seeks, so sincerity helps immensely in putting the extra effort and care, the gains are more relative to a less sincere seeker.
* **Adventurous**: Delving into deep research or picking up challenges for yourself to discover an aspect about it, taking things head on. A sort of obstacle is the way sort of mindset(stoic). This inner journey that is going on in the background is not easy so such a mindset helps pick up pace, inner flow. A bit of ambition maybe for something more in life.
* **Critical Thinking**: In the age of information consuming large amounts and being able to discern what is useful, valid and incorrect.
*  **Conscience**: An inner moral and ethical system. Preferably developed by self by pondering while passing through life or a chosen authority.
* A never give up attitude. Being ready to pay the price even if it maybe your own ego. Being willing to change yourself and work on yourself.

`You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.`

This is a description of the Seeker process that is running within.

Seeking is like a skill, which means you can train it and get good at it. Get good at identifying and solving a category/class of problems in your life. The seeker knows the theme of your life, it has accumulated however much was put into it.

The ultimate ideal of _Seeker_ within is a “Seeker of Truth”, someone who is looking for _Truth_ whatever it may mean to the seeker at that point in their journey. Now defining Truth and what all it can mean is a very deep topic in itself if not in a sense the only topic ever. Another post will be dedicated to various possible conceptions of Truth. Seeking Truth helps because the whole world is changing, a sort of instability that is worrisome, unreliable. Truth will be reliable forever, however harsh it maybe from personal world view a Seeker of Truth is willing to accept it if it is actually that.
