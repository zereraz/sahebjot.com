I'm Sahebjot and this is my blog.
I'm a software engineer, budding entrepreneur, deeply into spirituality. I am a **Sikh â˜¬**.

I started this blog mainly to practice my writing, which isn't great to be honest.

Posts will range across various topics, some dev, learning, growth, startups, personal experiences, meditation, psychology, health and esoteric eclectic world views.
